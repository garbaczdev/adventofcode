<h1>Advent of Code</h1>
<p>
    This repository contains my solutions for adventofcode.org (most often written in Python3).
    Note that the years 2020 and 2021 have been written in my high school times, when I was not
    great at coding, so please don't judge me based on the code quality of those programs :).
    Some day I will finish all of the years, but it will happen in the far future.

<p>
    Solutions for 2020 have been lost somewhere (back then I did not know what github was).
    I will publish them as soon as I find/rewrite them.
